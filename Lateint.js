In Kotlin, the lateinit keyword is used to declare a non-null property that will be assigned a value later, before its usage. It is primarily used to avoid the NullPointerException when initializing properties that cannot be assigned a value immediately, such as properties that are initialized in dependency injection frameworks or properties that are assigned in different lifecycle stages.

Here's an example of using the lateinit keyword:

kotlin
Copy code
class MyClass {
    lateinit var name: String
    
    fun initializeName() {
        name = "John"
    }
    
    fun printName() {
        if (::name.isInitialized) {
            println(name)
        } else {
            println("Name is not initialized yet")
        }
    }
}

fun main() {
    val obj = MyClass()
    obj.initializeName()
    obj.printName() // Output: John
}
In the example above, the name property is declared with the lateinit keyword. It is assigned a value later in the initializeName() function. The printName() function checks if the name property has been initialized using the isInitialized property reference check before accessing its value.

It's important to note a few things when using lateinit:

Only mutable properties of non-nullable types can be declared as lateinit.
The lateinit property must be initialized before accessing its value; otherwise, it will throw a lateinit property name has not been initialized exception.
lateinit properties cannot be used with properties that have custom getters or setters.
Although lateinit can be useful in certain scenarios, it should be used with caution as it bypasses the compiler's null safety checks. It's essential to ensure proper initialization of lateinit properties to avoid NullPointerExceptions.
