A backing field in Kotlin is an automatically generated field for a property that is used to store its value. Backing fields are generated when a property uses the default implementation of at least one of the accessors (getter or setter) or if a custom accessor references the backing field using the field identifier. They cannot be declared directly and can only be used inside the accessors. Backing fields help to avoid recursive calls and StackOverflowError when using custom accessors. kotlinlang.org, baeldung.com

Here's an example of using a backing field in Kotlin:

class MyClass {
    var value: Int = 0
        get() = field
        set(newValue) {
            if (newValue > 0) {
                field = newValue
            } else {
                println("Value should be greater than 0")
            }
        }
}
In this example, the value property has a custom setter that checks if the new value is greater than 0 before assigning it to the backing field. The field identifier is used to access the backing field inside the setter.

Backing fields are different from backing properties, which are separate private properties used to store the value of another public property with custom accessors. While backing fields are generated automatically and accessed using the field identifier, backing properties are explicitly declared and accessed like regular properties. baeldung.com
