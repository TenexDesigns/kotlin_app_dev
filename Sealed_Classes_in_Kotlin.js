In Kotlin, a sealed class is a special type of class that represents a restricted hierarchy of classes. It is used to define a closed set of subclasses that are known at compile-time. Sealed classes are commonly used in scenarios where a value can have one of several possible types, and you want to define and handle those types in a restricted manner.

Here's how you can declare a sealed class in Kotlin:

kotlin
Copy code
sealed class Result {
    class Success(val data: String) : Result()
    class Error(val message: String) : Result()
}
In the example above, Result is a sealed class with two subclasses: Success and Error. Both subclasses are defined as inner classes of the sealed class.

The key characteristics and usage of sealed classes include:

Limited Subclass Hierarchy: Sealed classes restrict the hierarchy of their subclasses. All subclasses must be defined within the same file as the sealed class itself. This limitation ensures that the possible subclasses are known and restricted.

Limited Instances: Sealed classes cannot be instantiated directly. You can only create instances of their subclasses. In the example above, you can create instances of Success and Error classes, but not the Result sealed class itself.

Pattern Matching with when: Sealed classes are often used in combination with the when expression for exhaustive pattern matching. The when expression allows you to handle different cases based on the specific subclasses of the sealed class. Since the compiler knows all possible subclasses, it can enforce that all cases are handled, providing better type safety. For example:

kotlin
Copy code
fun processResult(result: Result) {
    when (result) {
        is Result.Success -> println(result.data)
        is Result.Error -> println(result.message)
    }
}
In the processResult function, the when expression checks the type of the result parameter and handles each case accordingly.

Extension Functions: Sealed classes can have extension functions just like regular classes. You can define extension functions specifically for the sealed class or for its individual subclasses.

Sealed classes are powerful when used in combination with pattern matching and allow you to create type-safe code that handles a restricted set of possible types. They are particularly useful in scenarios where you want to represent a closed set of alternatives, such as handling different states, events, or response types.

  Sealed classes in Kotlin are used to represent restricted class hierarchies, where an object or value can have a type only among a specific set of options. They provide a way to create a controlled inheritance hierarchy, ensuring type safety by restricting types to be matched at compile-time rather than runtime. Sealed classes are implicitly abstract and cannot be instantiated directly geeksforgeeks.org.

To define a sealed class, use the sealed keyword before the class keyword:

sealed class Shape {
    class Circle(val radius: Float) : Shape()
    class Square(val length: Int) : Shape()
    class Rectangle(val length: Int, val breadth: Int) : Shape()
}
In this example, Shape is a sealed class with three subclasses: Circle, Square, and Rectangle. These subclasses can have their own properties and methods.

Sealed classes are often used with when expressions, as they provide a way to match all possible subclasses, ensuring that all cases are handled:

fun eval(shape: Shape) = when (shape) {
    is Shape.Circle -> println("Circle area is ${3.14 * shape.radius * shape.radius}")
    is Shape.Square -> println("Square area is ${shape.length * shape.length}")
    is Shape.Rectangle -> println("Rectangle area is ${shape.length * shape.breadth}")
}
In this example, the eval function uses a when expression to match the type of the Shape and calculate the area accordingly. Since all possible subclasses of the sealed class are handled, there is no need for an else branch in the when expression digitalocean.com.
