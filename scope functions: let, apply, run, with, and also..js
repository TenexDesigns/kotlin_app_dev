Kotlin provides several scope functions: let, apply, run, with, and also. 
These functions allow you to execute a block of code within a specific context and provide different ways of accessing and manipulating objects. 
While these functions have similarities, they differ in their behavior and the way they handle the context object.





1.let: The let function allows you to perform operations on a nullable object and avoid null-checks.
It takes the object as the receiver (this) and provides it as a lambda parameter (it). The result of the lambda is returned. 
This function is useful for transforming or chaining operations on an object.

val nullableValue: String? = "Hello"
val result = nullableValue?.let {
    // Perform operations on the non-null value
    it.length
}





2.apply: The apply function is used to configure an object by invoking a series of operations on it.
It takes the object as the receiver (this) and provides it as a lambda parameter (this). The result of the lambda is ignored, 
  and the modified object is returned. This function is commonly used for initializing properties of an object.

val person = Person().apply {
    name = "John"
    age = 30
}






3.run: The run function is similar to let, but it takes the object as the receiver (this) and provides it as a lambda parameter (this).
The result of the lambda is returned. This function is useful when you need to perform multiple operations on an object and return a result.

val person = Person("John", 30)
val result = person.run {
    // Perform operations on the person object
    "$name is $age years old."
}




4.with: The with function is a non-extension function that takes an object and a lambda as parameters.
It allows you to execute multiple operations on the object without the need to use this or it. The result of the lambda is returned. 
This function is primarily used to improve code readability by providing a concise way to work with an object.

val person = Person("John", 30)
val result = with(person) {
    // Perform operations on the person object
    "$name is $age years old."
}




5.also: The also function is similar to apply, but it takes the object as the receiver (this) and provides it as a lambda parameter (it).
The result of the lambda is ignored, and the original object is returned.
This function is useful when you want to perform some additional actions on an object while retaining the object itself.

val person = Person("John", 30)
val modifiedPerson = person.also {
    // Perform additional actions on the person object
    it.age += 1
}
In summary, the Kotlin scope functions (let, apply, run, with, and also) provide different ways to work with objects in a scoped manner.
They vary in terms of the object reference (this or it), the return value, and the purpose they serve. 
Choosing the appropriate scope function depends on your specific use case and the desired behavior for accessing and manipulating objects.

Kotlin provides five scope functions: let, apply, run, with, and also. These functions allow you to execute a block of code within the context of an object, making your code more concise and readable. Although they all perform the same action, they differ in how the object is accessed within the block and what the result of the whole expression is kotlinlang.org.

Here is a brief overview of each function:

let: It is an extension function that takes a lambda with the receiver object as its parameter. The object is accessed within the lambda using it or an optional custom name. The last expression in the lambda is returned blog.mindorks.com.
   val list = listOf(1, 2, 3)
   val doubledList = list.let { it.map { num -> num * 2 } }
apply: It is an extension function that takes a lambda with the receiver object as its this. The object is accessed using this. The object itself is returned, making it useful for object configuration digitalocean.com.
   data class Person(var name: String, var age: Int)
   val person = Person("Alice", 25).apply { age = 26 }
run: It is an extension function that takes a lambda with the receiver object as its this. The object is accessed using this. The last expression in the lambda is returned digitalocean.com.
   val result = "Hello, world!".run { length }
with: It is a regular function that takes an object as its first parameter and a lambda with the object as its this. The object is accessed using this. The last expression in the lambda is returned digitalocean.com.
   val person = Person("Alice", 25)
   val greeting = with(person) { "Hello, $name!" }
also: It is an extension function that takes a lambda with the receiver object as its parameter. The object is accessed within the lambda using it or an optional custom name. The object itself is returned, making it useful for additional actions on the object blog.mindorks.com.
   val list = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3)
   val updatedList = list.also { it.add(4) }
To choose the right scope function, consider the following factors:

How the object should be accessed within the block (this or it)
What the result of the whole expression should be (the object itself or the last expression)
